# HashCracker

This is a simple md5 hash cracker

# Usage
run **python3 hashcracker.py**

This will then prompt you for a wordlist file location and the hash you would like to enter


You can modify the hash type by changing the 'MD5' option within the script to the hash you are attempting to crack
